src/Utils/Context.h:12:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw.  If an attacker can change
  anything along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual
  use (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race
  condition. Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid()) and try to
  open the file directly.

src/Utils/MovieCreator.cpp:26:  [4] (shell) system:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely.
  try using a library call that implements the same functionality if
  available. 
src/SqlModule/SqlReader.cpp:307:  [2] (misc) open:
  Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks),
  force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move
  things around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change
  its contents?. 
src/SqlModule/SqlReader.cpp:286:  [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop.
